Overall
=======

Overall I really think this is a solid application.  I think that, most
importatly, you worked on this really well _together_.  The dynamics you
demonstrated while processing the trade-offs between techniques really warmed
the cockles of my robotic heart.  You are all able to talk and consider and
exchange ideas and I found it rewarding.

I'd also point out that the inside of the code is very sensible, very neat, and
consistent. I didn't see any strange or non-idiomatic usage within your Ruby
use. You did have a BEASTY method...but I think given our discussion of the
trade-offs made me appreciate your approach.

Choices Controller
==================

* Added an implementation that shows how to tighten up code

Misc Notes
==========

* The session is awesome and can hold all sorts of data.
* Lean on the params and url place holders over loading up hidden elements
  in views.
